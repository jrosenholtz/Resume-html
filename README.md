# Resume-html
Here is template version of my website and resume I created for the cloud resume challenge. Feel free to use this in any way you see fit.  

I started off with the template included in [this link](https://codepen.io/emzarts/pen/OXzmym) from the cloud resume challenge, but I modified it to suite my taste a bit more. Its a bit plain but I think it looks clean and professional. You can see my website at www.rosenholtz.net
